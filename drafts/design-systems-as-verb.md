Bullet points:

- What is a system? It's something that can break.
- Present scenario of two buttons on two pages.
- Note that the "break" happens regardless of whether a formal system was in place.
- The point of the "system" therefore is to make that break obvious so that it can be fixed before releasing to customers.
