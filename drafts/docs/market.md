Since the beginning of the web, the standard approach to UI design has been some variant of the following:

1. Create a series of drawings, where each drawing represents one page
2. Display the drawings side-by-side to show how a user might navigate between each page
3. Review the drawings with stakeholders
4. Hand the drawings over to a developer for implementation

The first tool used for this purpose was Adobe Photoshop, and it was so successful that no other tool seriously challenged it for years. But as websites grew in size and complexity, designers began to realize that the above workflow was not well suited for its task. It was simply not possible to manually draw a picture of every possible state of an application, especially for large applications that may have hundreds or thousands of states.

Designers have been aware of this problem for years, and as a result, there have been many attempts to improve UI design philosophies and processes. Each of these attempts added to the growing pile of industry-specific terminology - [Style Guides](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guides/), [Pattern Libraries](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns), etc. The latest industry term is [Design System](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969). The underlying trend behind all of these ideas is the notion that a UI design is a _system_, not merely a set of _drawings_.

It was only a matter of time before companies began to tune into these developments, so in 2011, Sketch was introduced and disrupted Adobe's monopoly over the market. One of the major advantages it had was the notion of "symbols", which could be used to build a design from reusable visual components. This reduced the amount of manual work needed for designers to update their projects. In the years after Sketch's introduction, a slew of similar products have entered the fray, each promising to deliver a more modern workflow. These new tools include Figma, Framer X, Invision Studio, and many others.

All of these tools accomplish one or two things well, but none of them so elegantly solve all the problems presented to modern designers that they have gained a clear lead in the market. The result is a fractious tooling landscape that leaves designers feeling overwhelmed by the number of choices, yet underwhelmed by each respective choice.

We believe that none of these new products have truly succeeded because they adopt legacy conventions around _what a design tool is_. In order to create a design tool that meets current needs, some fundamental notions have to be challenged. The design process itself needs to be refactored from the ground up, starting from first principles.
