## current tools problems
1. The UI is focused on manipulating a canvas with tools (drawing).
2. Reusability is a peripheral feature, not a first-class concept.
3. Few tools are strictly focused on UI design. Those that are focus almost exclusively on the web platform.
4. Virtually no tools incorporate version control of any kind.
5. There are virtually no features built around constraints, or visual logic.
6. No tools incorporate design analysis.
7. Few tools incorporate team management directly into the tool.
8. The few tools that focus on UI put too much focus on generating code (waste of time and resources).
9. Few tools offer interaction design (hover/click/drag/etc). Those that do focus exclusively on the web platform.
10. No tools encourage a rigorous/procedural approach.
11. Few tools offer helpful peripheral tools like color scheme generation, placeholder image generation, etc.
12. The "output" of most tools are simply files. No consideration for developer handoff.

## current tools problems
> Designing a digital user interface poses many unique challenges to a designer. Interfaces exhibit behavior, maintain state, express hierarchical relationships, and so on. They are not like posters or business cards, which are static and constrained to definite dimensions and proportions. Yet the tools available to UI designers are the same tools used to design posters and business cards.

## current tools problems
> Most design tools are constructed around what I call the "painting" model. In the center of the interface is a blank canvas, and on the side are tools which can be used to edit the surface of the canvas. This is the digital analogy of a painter, who uses brushes and paint (tools) to manipulate a canvas. Traditionally, UI designers will use a tool like this to draw pictures of an application, where each canvas represents either one page/view or state. The drawings are then combined in sequence to demonstrate a particular user path within the application. This model encourages page-centric design, which is inherently opposed to component-centric design.

## current tools problems
> Page-centric design works well for small products, like blogs or local business websites. But it does not scale, because often the product has to maintain brand and experience consistency across many different contexts and platforms. Focusing on the "page" or "view" leads to myopic design decisions that do not take into account all the other pages and views. On the other hand, a component-centric design process handles this problem well, because it establishes a consistent visual identity for each piece of an application. This allows each page and view to be *composed* of each individual portion of the UI, like building blocks.

## current tools problems
> Several new tools are focused on helping designers either write code, or create "production-ready" components without writing code. This is a mistake. There are implementation details in code that will always be irrelevant to designers. Instead, designers should "design to an interface, not an implementation".
