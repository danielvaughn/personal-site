Designers and developers must work intimately with one another if they wish to create a great product.
However, the tools, workflows, mental models, and terminology differ greatly between these two professions.
In many cases this makes sense, but nonetheless there exist frictions and difficulties that could otherwise be avoided.
Matry is inspired by the numerous attempts that have been made over the years to mitigate these issues.

The first notable source of inspiration was Atomic Design.
Created by Brad Frost in 2013, Atomic Design laid out a conceptual framework for UI architecture that could be shared by designers and developers.
His basic premise was that a design should be conceived as a system, and systems are built from the ground up from the smallest components.
He named these smallest components Atoms, and used that as the basis to build a hierarchical naming schema for rest of the system.

In his hierarchy, the categories are Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.
The term "Matry" is a direct response to this kind of categorization.
I feel that such a hierarchy can only lead to confusion in the end, as it's too difficult for teams to gain a common understanding of which components belong in which category.
Matry's philosophy is that all components share the same features and should thus be defined equally - it's "components all the way down."
I feel that a UI's component architecture is best conceived as a Matryoshka doll (a Russian nesting doll).
Open each layer, starting with the outermost, and you'll find the same thing at each point.
The only difference between each layer is size.

Nonetheless, Atomic Design was a brilliant step forward for the industry.
The true innovation was the notion that a design is best built from the bottom up, not from the top down.

A second source of inspiration came from browser developer tools, notably the Chrome Dev Tools.
After becoming a web developer, I slowly began designing websites directly in the browser, using these tools.
There are several interesting tradeoffs between designing with traditional Adobe-style apps vs browsers:
