## solution

Matry is a new kind of tool for designing user interfaces. Where other applications can mostly be thought of as drawing tools, Matry is instead focused on describing and composing visual attributes.

Designers will use Matry to prototype interfaces "from the bottom up" - starting from the smallest components and working up to the largest. Each component is designed in isolation, meaning no unnecessary distractions.

This shift has dramatic effects on all aspects of the design experience. Matry establishes several new concepts that have previously never existed in design tools:

1. Separation of concerns (models vs styles)
2. Input and Output
3. Isolated component design
4. Lateral design
5. Parametric constraints
6. Tokens
7. Analysis

If you are interested in learning what each of these mean, and how they could revolutionize the design workflow, keep reading!

#### 1. Separation of Concerns

In software development, the phrase "separation of concerns" is well-known, but it is unfamiliar in the design world. Matry aims to introduce this concept to interface designers.
