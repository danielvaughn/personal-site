I hadn't worked on Stride in a while, outside of the structured editing experiments from last month.
Tonight I took the original Vite-based project and converted it to Astro.

I'm a fan of Astro, though it's showing warts with Stride.
There are several highly custom features with Stride because I'm breaking a lot of typical "rules" you may expect the average web application to follow, and it's obvious that Astro was designed with some of those more common use cases in mind.
