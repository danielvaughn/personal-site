I turn 40 this year, which given average lifespan of an adult in the USA, means that I'm just at the halfway mark.
The occasion has brought about a more-than-usual number of pensive moments, causing me to reflect on my life thus far.

As the title suggests, I've been in the workforce for 30 years.
My uncle owned a well-known restaurant in my hometown, and was kind enough to give me a job as a dishwasher when I was just 10 years old.
Aside from a few periods here and there, I've held a job ever since.

To mark my 40th trip around the sun, I'd like to take a moment and reflect on each of those work experiences,
and the lessons I learned from each one.

1. _Dishwasher at Buntyn Cafe, Memphis TN_  
   In 1994, my uncle gave me a job as a dishwasher at our family restaurant. I was 10 years old.  
   lesson: **Hard work earns you respect, and can feel good.**

2. _Busboy at Bunytn Cafe, Memphis TN_  
   A few years later, the restaurant changed locations.
   My uncle let me begin working out front as a busboy.  
   lesson: **Hard work does not necessarily lead to success.**

3. _Line Cook at Buntyn Cafe, Cordova TN_  
   Soon after, he opened a second location out in the suburbs.
   I began working out there as a line cook at 15.  
   lesson: **Treat work as a game and you can work hard without tiring yourself out.**

4. _Brickmason's Assistant, Bartlett TN_  
   At the age of 17, I decided to move on from restaurant work.
   A buddy of mine hooked me up with a brickmason who needed an assistant.
   I worked with him throughout an unusually hot Memphis summer.  
   lesson: **You don't need to have it all figured out in order to make your own living**

5. _Retail Associate, Cordova TN_  
   I couldn't devote daytime hours to laying brick while I was in school,
   so I got another job folding clothes at American Eagle in my nearby mall.  
   lesson: **Even the most menial job can teach you invaluable skills**
